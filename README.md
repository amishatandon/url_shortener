## URL Shortener Service with Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Flutter
This project is a URL shortener service that allows users to convert long URLs into easily shareable short links. 
## It features a full-stack implementation with:
## Backend: 
Built with Node.js and Express, using MongoDB for data storage. The backend handles URL shortening and redirection through a REST API.
## Frontend: 
Developed using Flutter, providing a user-friendly interface for generating and displaying shortened URLs.
## Key Features
Shortening URLs: Users can input a long URL, and the backend generates a shortened version.

Fetching Shortened URLs: Users can retrieve the shortened URL by querying with the original URL.

Redirection: Shortened URLs redirect users to the original URL when accessed.

User Interface: A Flutter app that allows users to interact with the URL shortener service, including inputting URLs, viewing shortened links, and copying them to the clipboard.

## How It Works
## Frontend (Flutter):
Users enter a long URL into the Flutter app.

The app sends the URL to the backend for shortening.

The app displays the shortened URL and provides options to copy it.

## Backend (Node.js & Express):
Receives the long URL from the Flutter app.

Generates a unique code for the URL and stores it in MongoDB.

Returns the shortened URL to the Flutter app.

Handles redirection from the shortened URL to the original URL.

## Database (MongoDB):
Stores the mapping between original URLs and their corresponding shortened codes.
